Background project

Sometimes, we need to know the temperature of our room. The one of the functions is to know if there is overheat or not. We also need to know air quality in our room to keep our healtly. So, using IoT, We want to make Temperature, Humidity and Air Quality Control using smartphone


How the tool works

We put the microcontroller in the room. DHT 22 will take the Temperature and Humidity and MQ – 135 will take the parameter of Air Quality. We use blynk to monitoring the value. The microcontroller which connected to internet connection will send the Temperature, humidity and air quality data to blynk cloud and the cloud will send the data to our app.
